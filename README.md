# Formula-1-Tire-Degredation-Simulator
Calculate whether an f1 car needs a pit stop or not.

In this project, I developed a Java program that allows users to create their own Grand Prix race strategy by entering a driver's past five lap times. The program compares the current driver's average lap time with the historical race pace of the track and generates a suggestion on whether it is time for a pit stop or not.

* Please note when you enter the Grand Prix you want it must be spelled correctly for the program to run. You will get an error message if it is wrong. 

What I learned: 
> This project taught me a lot about planning out my code, working with libraries, and working with relatively large data files. This project had a lot more complexity compared to all my previous ones, and I quickly discovered the value of making a list of steps to do and writing pseudocode. Doing so kept me organized and saved me a lot of time. 
> Working with libraries was a significant aspect of this project, and it presented me with the opportunity to explore the vast array of resources available. I discovered that leveraging existing libraries, such as Apache POI, not only saves time and effort but also enables me to tap into the expertise of the developer community, enhancing the functionality and efficiency of my code.
> Furthermore, working with large Excel data files was a notable challenge that pushed me to expand my skills. I learned how to combine data from multiple years into a single file, format the data effectively, and process it efficiently.

Looking ahead, I plan to enhance this project by incorporating additional variables into the calculation, such as tire temperature, track positions, and tire compound. By doing so, I aim to increase the accuracy of the predictions and create an even more exciting and comprehensive tool.
